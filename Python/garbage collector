Awesome question, Jashuva! ðŸ™Œ  
Memory management is one of the strong suits of Python, and it happens mostly **behind the scenes** â€” but let me break it down clearly for you:

---

### ðŸ§  **How Memory is Managed in Python:**

---

### 1. **Automatic Memory Management**
- Python takes care of memory allocation and deallocation automatically.
- You donâ€™t have to use `malloc()` or `free()` like in C/C++.

---

### 2. **Reference Counting**
- Every object in Python has a **reference count** (i.e., how many variables point to it).
- When an objectâ€™s reference count drops to **zero**, it is no longer used and is **marked for garbage collection**.

```python
a = "hello"
b = a  # reference count of "hello" is now 2
del a  # reference count becomes 1
del b  # reference count becomes 0 â†’ memory freed
```

---

### 3. **Garbage Collection (GC)**
- Python has a **garbage collector** that removes unused objects (especially in cases of circular references).
- It runs **automatically** in the background, but you can manually trigger it:

```python
import gc
gc.collect()
```

---

### 4. **Private Heap Space**
- All Python objects and data structures are stored in a **private heap**.
- Only the Python interpreter can access this heap â€” it's not accessible directly by you.

---

### 5. **Memory Pools (via PyMalloc)**
- Python uses an internal memory manager called **PyMalloc** for small memory allocations.
- It reduces the overhead of system-level memory allocation.

---

### 6. **Object Reuse (Interning)**
- Python reuses some immutable objects (like small integers and strings) to save memory.

```python
a = 100
b = 100
print(a is b)  # True â†’ same memory location

a = 1000
b = 1000
print(a is b)  # Might be False â†’ different memory locations
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Example: Check Object Address

```python
x = 5
print(id(x))  # Shows memory address of object
```

---

### ðŸ”„ Summary:

| Feature                | Description                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Automatic Allocation   | Handled by Python during variable assignment        |
| Reference Counting     | Tracks number of references to an object            |
| Garbage Collection     | Frees memory when objects are no longer in use      |
| Private Heap           | Stores all Python objects internally                |
| Memory Pooling         | Efficient allocation for small objects (PyMalloc)   |
