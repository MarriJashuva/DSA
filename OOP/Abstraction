### üî• What is Abstraction in Python?

**Abstraction** is the concept of **hiding the complex implementation details** and exposing only the essential features of an object or function. 

In simpler terms, **abstraction** allows us to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it.

---

## üìå Why is Abstraction Important?

1. **Simplifies Complex Systems**: By hiding unnecessary details, we can focus on higher-level operations.
2. **Improves Maintainability**: Changes in the internal implementation don't affect the external interface.
3. **Encapsulation of Functionality**: We can expose only what is needed and hide the rest for security or complexity management.

### ‚úÖ Achieving Abstraction in Python

Python achieves abstraction using **abstract classes** and **abstract methods**. These are part of the `abc` module.

---

### üöÄ 1. **Abstract Classes** and **Abstract Methods**

An **abstract class** is a class that **cannot be instantiated** directly. It is meant to be subclassed, and it can contain **abstract methods**. An **abstract method** is a method that is declared but doesn't have an implementation in the abstract class. The child class must implement these methods.

#### Steps to Create Abstraction:
1. Use the `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) class from the `abc` module.
2. Mark the abstract method with `@abstractmethod`.

---

### Example: Abstract Class and Abstract Method

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):  # Abstract class
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):  # Abstract method (no implementation here)
        pass

class Dog(Animal):  # Child class
    def speak(self):  # Must implement the abstract method
        print("Dog barks")

class Cat(Animal):  # Another child class
    def speak(self):  # Must implement the abstract method
        print("Cat meows")

# animal = Animal()  # ‚ùå Cannot instantiate abstract class
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks
cat.speak()  # Output: Cat meows
```

#### Key Points:
- **Abstract Class**: `Animal` is abstract, so we can't create an instance of it.
- **Abstract Method**: `speak()` is an abstract method, so it has no body in `Animal` but must be implemented in child classes like `Dog` and `Cat`.
