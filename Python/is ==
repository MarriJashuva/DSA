In Python, `is` and `==` are both used for comparison, but they serve different purposes. Let's break down the differences between them:

### 1. **`==` (Equality Operator)**
   - **Purpose**: The `==` operator checks whether the **values** of two objects are equal.
   - **Usage**: It compares the contents of the objects.
   - **When to use**: Use `==` when you want to check if the **values** of two objects are the same, regardless of whether they are the same object in memory.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   a = [1, 2, 3]
   b = [1, 2, 3]
   
   print(a == b)  # Output: True, because the lists have the same values
   ```

   Even though `a` and `b` are two different objects in memory, their values are equal, so `==` returns `True`.

### 2. **`is` (Identity Operator)**
   - **Purpose**: The `is` operator checks whether two objects **refer to the same object** in memory (i.e., they have the same identity).
   - **Usage**: It compares the **memory location** or **identity** of the objects, not their values.
   - **When to use**: Use `is` when you want to check if two variables point to the **same object** in memory.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   a = [1, 2, 3]
   b = [1, 2, 3]
   
   print(a is b)  # Output: False, because a and b are two different objects in memory
   ```

   Even though `a` and `b` have the same value, they are stored in different memory locations, so `is` returns `False`.
